# Sorting Algorithms

This is a project to create and evaluate the speed of different algorithms with sets of data. A future evolution of this project will be to compare the results across different programming languages.

## What is a sorting algorithm?

A sorting algoirthm is an alogirthm that will order the elements of a list. Sorting algorithms are often used for lists of values but they can be used for any object using that objects comparison operator. An example of this is strings, they can be organised alphabetically using the ASCII value of characters. Algorithms are associated with a time and space complexity. There are 3 time complexity values that are used to identify the performance of the algorithm and these are: best case, average case, and worst case. This relates to the amount of time the algorithm will take to order a list based on the input in related to the size of the list. It is given in the form of big o notation where n is the length of the list (O(n)). 

## How will algorithms be tested?

Alogithms will be tested by using execution time. The algorithms will be tested using the same data to keep the comparsions fair. Additionally, the tests will be executed many times and averaged, this has been done in order to account for any background tasks interferring with the execution of the algorithms.

## What algorithms will be explored?

The algorithms that have been chosen are a mix of the most commonly used sorting algorithms. A variety of sorting methods are being tested, such as: partitioning, merging, insertion, exchange, and selection. Algorithms will be tested using iterative and recursive methods if available to compare if there is any differences.

Algorithms that have been implemented are:
* Bubble Sort (Python, Java, C++)
* Bubble Sort With Early Exit (Python, Java, C++)
* Selection Sort (Python, Java, C++)
* Merge Sort (Recursive) (Python, Java)
* Merge Sort (Iterative) (Python, Java)
* Quick Sort (Recursive) (Python, Java)
* Tree Sort (Allows duplicates through count variable) (Python, Java)
* Counting Sort (Python, Java)
* Bucket Sort (Python, Java)
* Odd-Even Sort (Python, Java)
* Bogo Sort/Stupid Sort (Python, Java)
